Main:

First, I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.

* Created the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` with

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

Bonus: 'bonus.html' & 'bonus.css'
*  I used the media query to create a 'bonus.html' file with mobile responsive.
